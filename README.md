# stateless-pancaketh

Ethereum stateless guest in [Pancake](https://cakeml.org/pancake). Pancake is
a programming language with a formally verified compiler (currently
[being ported](https://github.com/pirapira/flapjack) to Lean).

## Goal

Port `evm-asm/EvmAsm/Stateless/SpecRef` (the pure-Lean functional port of
execution-specs' Amsterdam `run_stateless_guest`) to Pancake source in
`guest/src/`, compiled to a RISC-V ELF that obeys the same guest contract as
evm-asm's `stateless_guest` (input at `0x40000000`, output at `0xa0010000`,
halt via `ecall a7=93`), so evm-asm's `spike_run` and `ziskemu` can run it
unchanged, as an alternative to evm-asm's hand-written/codegen RV64 guest.

## Status

* **Same RISC-V code from both compilers.** `flapjack` (the Lean 4 port of
  Pancake, `lake exe flapjack-compile`) builds the full guest and produces
  code that is instruction-for-instruction identical to the original
  HOL-verified `cake --pancake --target=riscv` compiler's output: same
  bytes, same Spike/ziskemu step counts, same static-analysis warnings, and
  `30/30 PASS(full)` for each, on the 30-fixture correctness baseline. See
  [docs/ZISK-PROVE-FLAPJACK.md](docs/ZISK-PROVE-FLAPJACK.md).
* **EEST fixtures.** The guest passes the entire `tests-zkevm` corpus: a
  pinned, reproducible run ([docs/EEST-SPIKE.md](docs/EEST-SPIKE.md)) with
  the accelerated guest reports 26,104/26,104 records (26,096 `PASS(full)`,
  8 expected `PASS(malformed)` rejects), 0 failures. Day-to-day CI
  (`tools/check_all.sh`) ratchets a sampled 838-fixture baseline
  (`tools/eest-baseline.json`) on every change instead of the full corpus;
  it currently shows 0 unexpected failures, plus 2 allowed `ERROR`s from two
  BLS12-381 G2-MSM fixtures that exceed the Spike runner's step cap on the
  unaccelerated software guest only (a harness limitation, not an output
  mismatch).
* **A real chain block.** The guest reproduces a real `glamsterdam-devnet-7`
  block (`115260`, 65.3M gas) exactly, matching the network's recorded
  output byte-for-byte, on both the `cake`- and `flapjack`-compiled guests —
  see [docs/ZISK-PROVE-REAL-BLOCK-FLAPJACK.md](docs/ZISK-PROVE-REAL-BLOCK-FLAPJACK.md)
  and [issue #54](https://github.com/pirapira/stateless-pancaketh/issues/54).

## Toolchain

* `flapjack` (Lean 4 port of the Pancake compiler, `lake exe flapjack-compile`):
  version pinned by the `flapjack` *lake* dependency in `lakefile.toml` (see
  `lake-manifest.json` for the exact commit; the `flapjack` git submodule is a
  separate, uninitialized checkout used only by other tooling, not by
  `lake`). `guest/build.sh` uses it by default (triggering `lake build` on
  first use); see the "Status" section above for the correctness comparison
  against the original HOL-verified compiler, and
  [docs/ZISK-PROVE-FLAPJACK.md](docs/ZISK-PROVE-FLAPJACK.md) for a full
  ziskemu/`cargo-zisk prove` run.
* `riscv64-unknown-elf-{as,ld}` (Ubuntu `binutils-riscv64-unknown-elf`).
* `spike_run`, a custom driver built on top of Spike (`riscv-isa-sim`,
  checked out as this repo's `riscv-isa-sim` submodule — see "Quick start"
  below to initialize it). Build it once (needs `libboost-all-dev` and
  `device-tree-compiler`), then build `spike_run` against it (needs
  `libssl-dev`); `evm-asm/scripts/spike/build.sh` finds the submodule at its
  default `SPIKE_SRC` path, no override needed:

  ```bash
  mkdir -p riscv-isa-sim/build
  (cd riscv-isa-sim/build && ../configure)   # parentheses = subshell, so this `cd` doesn't persist
  make -C riscv-isa-sim/build -j"$(nproc)"
  evm-asm/scripts/spike/build.sh
  ```
* ZisK toolchain via `ziskup` (https://ziskup.zisk.tech): `ziskup -v 0.18.0
  --provingkey`, giving `~/.zisk/bin/ziskemu` for step counts and
  `~/.zisk/bin/cargo-zisk` for STARK proofs.
* Python oracle: `uv run --directory evm-asm/execution-specs python ...`.

## Quick start

This repo's `evm-asm` submodule (EEST fixture tag and converter) and
`riscv-isa-sim` submodule (Spike) are needed; initialize them if missing:

```bash
git submodule update --init evm-asm riscv-isa-sim
```

`tools/eest-run.py` uses Spike by default and needs
`evm-asm/scripts/spike/spike_run` built first (see "Toolchain" above for
the `riscv-isa-sim` build prerequisites):

```bash
mkdir -p riscv-isa-sim/build
(cd riscv-isa-sim/build && ../configure)   # parentheses = subshell, so this `cd` doesn't persist
make -C riscv-isa-sim/build -j"$(nproc)"
evm-asm/scripts/spike/build.sh
```

```bash
tools/make-inputs.sh 50                       # work/inputs/manifest.tsv
tools/build_both.sh                            # software + accelerated ELFs
tools/eest-run.py guest/build/guest.elf work/inputs/manifest.tsv --quiet-passes
tools/eest-run.py guest/build/guest-accel.elf work/inputs/manifest.tsv --quiet-passes
```

For a pinned, self-contained full-corpus run through Spike, including the
recorded commit and result, see [docs/EEST-SPIKE.md](docs/EEST-SPIKE.md).

For running the guest under `ziskemu` and generating an actual ZisK STARK
proof of an execution (small example plus an EEST test fixture, with
recorded timings; the guest is compiled by `flapjack`, including the
correctness comparison against `cake`), see
[docs/ZISK-PROVE-FLAPJACK.md](docs/ZISK-PROVE-FLAPJACK.md). For the same
pipeline against a real chain block (the devnet-7 block from issue #54), see
[docs/ZISK-PROVE-REAL-BLOCK-FLAPJACK.md](docs/ZISK-PROVE-REAL-BLOCK-FLAPJACK.md).

## Tools

`guest/build.sh` accepts `DEBUG=1` to define `GUEST_DEBUG`; this preserves the
debug bytes at output offsets 69, 70, and 100. The default build omits those
stores. For example:

```bash
DEBUG=1 guest/build.sh guest/src/main.pnk guest/build/guest-debug.elf
```

`tools/build_both.sh` builds the two main guests used by differential checks:
`guest/build/guest.elf` is the software/reference build and
`guest/build/guest-accel.elf` is built with `ACCEL=1`. The software path remains
the default implementation; the accelerated path reaches the same precompile
acceleration points through Spike or ziskemu.

`tools/eest-run.py` uses Spike by default and supports several ways to narrow
down a failing sweep:

```bash
tools/eest-run.py guest/build/guest.elf work/inputs/manifest.tsv --json work/run/results.json
tools/eest-run.py guest/build/guest.elf work/inputs/manifest.tsv \
  --from-json work/run/results.json --fail-code 1/99
```

`--labels FILE` selects one manifest label per line (blank lines and lines
starting with `#` are ignored). A JSON run records the classification, debug
bytes, regions, and steps for each fixture. When failures exist, the runner
also prints a histogram grouped by result regions and debug failure code.

For the per-function profile, build the histogram-enabled Spike runner first,
then pass `--profile` to `tools/bench.py`:

```bash
tools/spike_prof/build.sh
tools/bench.py guest/build/guest.elf work/inputs/manifest.tsv --profile
```

`tools/check_all.sh` saves command output under `$CHECK_ALL_LOG_DIR` (default
`work/check-all`). `CHECK_ALL_INPUT_COUNT` controls the generated EEST sample
size, and `CHECK_ALL_EEST_JOBS` controls EEST parallelism. The alt_bn128
vector checker can run a quick ECADD/ECMUL smoke check with:

```bash
tools/check_bn254.sh --only 1,2
```

`check_all.sh` builds and checks both main guests with Spike, compares every
EEST output file byte-for-byte, and runs the unit/vector checks in both modes.
Because ziskemu is considerably slower than Spike, its accelerated parity gate
is opt-in: set `CHECK_ALL_ZISKE_PARITY=1` to run the accelerated guest under
ziskemu and compare those output files with the accelerated Spike run.

The checker also covers pairing and field-tower records; select those record
types with `--only` when running the slower software reference cases.

## Testing

Run `tools/check_all.sh` for the unit/oracle tests, vector checks, and every
EEST manifest under `work/inputs*/manifest.tsv`. If `work/inputs/manifest.tsv`
is absent, it generates a 30-fixture baseline first; set
`CHECK_ALL_INPUT_COUNT` to choose another size. EEST results are checked
against the checked-in `tools/eest-baseline.json`: a fixture that passed in
the baseline must keep passing, while recorded failures are allowed only with
the same failure class/code. A better result passes with a refresh hint; use
`python3 tools/eest-baseline.py update MANIFEST.tsv RESULTS.json` after
reviewing the improvement. Each check gets a PASS/FAIL line, detailed output
is saved under `work/check-all/`, and regressions make the script exit
non-zero.

For performance work, `bench.py --elf2` prints paired software/accelerated
columns for Spike instructions, ZisK STEPS, TOTAL cost, and PRECOMPILES cost:

```bash
tools/bench.py guest/build/guest.elf work/inputs/manifest.tsv \
  --elf2 guest/build/guest-accel.elf --limit 3
```

For a single guest, or for performance work that needs a JSON snapshot, use:

```bash
tools/bench.py guest/build/guest.elf work/inputs/manifest.tsv --json work/bench/new.json
tools/bench_compare.py work/bench/baseline-main.json work/bench/new.json
```

The comparator prints per-fixture and total Spike instruction, ZisK step, and
ZisK cost deltas, and exits non-zero for an `ok` regression or more than 2%
Spike instruction growth (override with `--max-regress`). After reviewing a
new main baseline, regenerate it with the same `bench.py` command using
`work/bench/baseline-main.json`, force-add that ignored file with
`git add -f`, and paste the comparator output into the performance PR.

## Plan

1. Port the stateless guest to Pancake, compiled by a formally verified compiler.
2. Prove a more useful version of "source terminates ⇒ RISC-V terminates," aware of step counts.
3. Bound the number of source steps under 200M gas.
4. Bound memory usage under 200M gas.
5. Combine these into an autoresearch-ready theorem.

See `PLAN.md` for the detailed milestone log. Deliberate numeric-width and
saturation boundaries are documented in [docs/ENVELOPE.md](docs/ENVELOPE.md).
